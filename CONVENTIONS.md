- Always include short sphinx/numpy-style docstrings with no empty lines, combine lines with three quotes and text, and use `\n` on the first line.
- Start commit messages describing new code using `+`, removed code using `-` , or refactors and fixes using `~`.
- Encapuslate imports within function definitions rather than at top of file whererever possible.
- Use precise variable names and code structure, and avoid code comments.
- Use snake_case and sequences of full words for variables rather than abbreviations or truncations of words.
- Prefer built-in types like `|`, instead of `Optional` and typing` import.
