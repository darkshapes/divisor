- Prefer first party imports over adding dependencies over writing own code.
- Format first party imports to be above dependency imports, which are above current project imports.
- Use precise variable names instead of comments.
- Either return the full code or only change code where required.
- Use snake_case and sequences of full words for variables rather than abbreviations or truncations of words.
- In commit messages, use + for code adds, - for code subtractions, and ~ for refactors/fixes over semantic commit messages.
- Always include sphinx/numpy style docstrings.
- Use `\n` instead of a line break on first line of docstrings.
- Encapuslate imports within functions where possible.
- Prefer requests over httpx for making http requests.
- Prefer built-in types like `|`, instead of `Optional` and typing` import.
- Always avoid use of `Any`.
- Do not add global variables.
- `pdocs` documentation `pdoc -o /docs <project name>`
- `pytest` testing `pytest -vv`
- `ruff` formatting
- `ruff` linting
- `pyright` type checking
